Front-end Engineer who wants to keep learning on how applications work and live on the internet F-O-R-E-V-E-R. Finished my bootcamp May '19 and officially hooked on developing native/web applications. Truly believe coding has opened doors and paths I couldn't even imagine were available and accessible to someone with my background. Constantly trying to learn new tech/languages/frameworks and seeking to collab on a new project (hopefully the next MtnProject because I'd appreciate a better app please 😅)
